1. If you are using your own domain:
   1. [Set your domain up for GitHub pages.](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)
   1. Change the URL in `CNAME` file to your domain.
1. If you are using GitHub page's default domain i.e. Something like
   `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   1. Delete the `CNAME` file.
   1. Change `var PATH_SEGMENTS_TO_SKIP = 0;` at the top of `404.html` to
      `var PATH_SEGMENTS_TO_SKIP = 1;`.
      1. This is as GitHub domains have an additional path segment (the repo
         name) after the host name.
1. Create a new repo as a database. (Or you could use your forked repo)
   1. Update `var GITHUB_ISSUES_LINK = "<your-github-issues-link>";` at the top
      of `404.html` accordingly afterwards.
      1. Format for `GITHUB_ISSUES_LINK`:
         `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/`
      1. Remember the trailing `/`!
1. Push your changes to your forked repo, and your low cost and cool as heck URL
   shortener will be ready for use!
